# GoCommerce [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/netlify/gocommerce.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/netlify/gocommerce)

A small go based API for static e-commerce sites.

It handles orders and payments. Integrates with Stripe for payments and will support
international pricing and VAT verification.

GoCommerce is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
Please make sure you understand its [implications and guarantees](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2016/09/21/MIT-License-Line-by-Line.html).

### What your static site must support

Each product you want to sell from your static site must have unique URL where GoCommerce
can find the meta data needed for calculating pricing and taxes in order to verify that
the order is legitimate before using Stripe to charge the client.

The metadata can be anywhere on the page, and goes in a script tag in this format:

```html
<script class="gocommerce-product" type="application/json">
{"sku": "my-product", "title": "My Product", "prices": [{"amount": "49.99", "currency": "USD"}], "type": "ebook"}
</script>
```

The minimum required is the Sku, title and at least one "price". Default currency is USD if nothing else specified.

### VAT, Countries and Regions

GoCommerce will regularly check for a file called `https://example.com/gocommerce/settings.json`

This file should have settings with rules for VAT or currency regions.

This file is not required for GoCommerce to work, but will enable support for various advanced
features. Currently it enables VAT calculations on a per country/product type basic.

The reason we make you include the file in the static site, is that you'll need to do the same
VAT calculations client side during checkout to be able to show this to the user. The
[commerce-js](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-commerce-js) client library can help you with
this.

Here's an example settings file:

```json
{
  "taxes": [{
    "percentage": 20,
    "product_types": ["ebook"],
    "countries": ["Austria", "Bulgaria", "Estonia", "France", "Gibraltar", "Slovakia", "United Kingdom"]
  }, {
    "percentage": 7,
    "product_types": ["book"],
    "countries": ["Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", "Denmark", "Estonia"]
  }]
}
```

Based on these rules, if an order includes a product with "type" set to "ebook" in the product metadata
on the site and the users billing Address is set to "Austria", GoCommerce will verify that a 20 percentage
tax has been included in that product.


## JavaScript Client Library

The easiest way to use GoCommerce is with [commerce-js](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-commerce-js).

## Running the GoCommerce backend

GoCommerce can be deployed to any server environment that runs Go. The button below provides a quick way to get started by running on Heroku:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/netlify/gocommerce)

## Configuration

You may configure GoCommerce using either a configuration file named `.env`,
environment variables, or a combination of both. Environment variables are prefixed with `GOCOMMERCE_`, and will always have precedence over values provided via file.

For local dev, the easiest way to get started is to copy the included `example.env` file to `.env`
